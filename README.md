## 🌱 About Me  

I’m a Computer Science student who believes that **technology should not only scale — it should care**.

My interests lie in:

- 🧩 **Problem Solving (DSA)**
- 🌍 **Social-impact driven product design**
- ✍️ Text-first, friction-aware platforms that encourage reflection over addiction

I enjoy building projects that question *how* and *why* systems are designed — not just *what* they do.
